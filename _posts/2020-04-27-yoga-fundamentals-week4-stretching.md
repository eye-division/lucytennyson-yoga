Yoga Fundamentals Week 4: Stretching

Stretching builds upon our last two weeks' themes of flexibility and strength. We need to think about all three when we move during our yoga practice.

The order of things is generally first start to move gently, mobilising the joints and then warming up. A little bit of stretching is acceptable, but if you are then going to move onto some stronger posture work, then the deep stretching is best done afterwards. The same applies to other forms of movement/exercise. Best to save your yoga and stretching for afterwards.

Here is a stretching sequence focussing on the legs and hips:

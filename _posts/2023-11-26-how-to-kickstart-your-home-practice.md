1\. PLAN IT

Make a decision. Simply nailing yourself down to a day (maybe three, maybe five times a week) is the first step in ensuring practice happens. Decide on a time and try to keep to it, just like any other appointment.

2\. START SMALL

Be realistic - &nbsp;15 or 20 minutes is fine.

3\. LEAVE YOUR MAT OUT

Try and dedicate a corner of a room for your practice and leave your mat there. Play some quiet calming music if you wish.

4\. PRACTICE AS EARLY IN THE DAY AS YOU CAN

After a cup of tea, and before breakfast is ideal. Think of a gentle warm up and then pick a couple of postures. Or a slow sun salutation.

5\. TAKE A FEW BREATHS FIRST

Take a moment to sit before you begin, try and let go of your thoughts, and release them with your breath.

6\. START WITH SOMETHING YOU LIKE DOING

It might simply be lying down on your back with your knees bent into your chest and rolling around. It might standing and doing some stepping and twists; a few rolls of your shoulders or your wrists. Anything you remember or anything you enjoy is a great place to start.

7\. FINISH WITH A NAMASTE TO YOURSELF

Well done! Sit quietly for a few moments before getting up.

However, yoga tends to attract already flexible people, while those with tighter bodies can be put off (especially if the class brings out our more competitive edge!).&nbsp;</p><p>Those of you who come to my classes, will know how much I discourage this aspect of modern yoga. If you (like me) fall into the latter category there is even MORE reason to take up yoga.</p><p>Yoga is a holistic discipline working on the mind body. This is something that distinguishes yoga from most other forms of exercise.&nbsp;</p><p>This week, we focussed on asanas (or postures) that involved some deep stretches. But, although you might think that flexibility comes about as a result of doing more and deeper stretches, it isn't quite as simple as that.</p><p>Many people think stretching is essential: runners stretch their hamstrings before hitting the pavement, gymnasts do deep splits during their warm-ups - and yogis wind down their practice with some forward bends.</p><p>But does stretching really prevent tight hamstrings and stiff shoulders? And if so, how? It turns out that scientists don't fully understand what happens during a stretch.</p><p>Yoga will make you more flexible, but we are still not sure how, as it appears that stretching doesn't actually make muscles permanently longer.</p><p>Instead, it may be that exercises such as reaching for your toes train the nervous system to tolerate a greater degree of muscle extension without firing off pain signals. This means traditional, passive stretches may not always be the best way to accomplish that task.</p><p>The nervous system is the master conductor determining how far a person can stretch, it appears. &nbsp;These nerves will tell the brain 'you better stop stretching, because if you stretch further, the muscle might be damaged.</p><p>That's why a person under anaesthesia, whose nerves are quieted, can be stretched through a full range of motion with no resistance. And healthy babies are born able to do the splits, because they haven't developed a blueprint for ranges of motion that feel unsafe.</p><p>Those repeated poses we do in yoga work on more than just a physical level, retraining the nervous system to be quiet at deeper levels of stretch, a process known as stretch tolerance. It's a mind and body thing, and that's what is special about a yoga practice.</p><p>Below is a reminder of some of the stretches we did in class this week.</p><p><img src="/uploads/versions/img-20161104-0001---x----1772-2488x---.jpg" alt="" /></p></div>

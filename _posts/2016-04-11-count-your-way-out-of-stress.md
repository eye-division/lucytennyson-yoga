It can be described quite simply as the conscious decision to quieten the mind by focusing on one thing (in this case the count) to the exclusion of all else.</p><p>At the beginning or end of my yoga classes, I often invite you to follow or count the breath to slow down busy minds and access a more peaceful space inside.</p><p>There are different ways of counting the breath to relax, for instance counting up to 3 or 4 on the inhale and exhale; or counting up to 10 slowly and mindfully. You can try different methods, and opt for one you feel most comfortable with.&nbsp;</p><p>Some people like to work around the number 108 which has long been considered a sacred number in Hinduism. Traditionally, malas, or garlands of prayer beads, come as a string of 108 beads (plus one for the &ldquo;guru bead,&rdquo; around which the other 108 beads turn like the planets around the sun). A mala is used for counting as you repeat a mantra&mdash;much like the Catholic rosary.</p><p>Renowned mathematicians of Vedic culture viewed 108 as a number of the wholeness of existence. This number also connects the Sun, Moon, and Earth: The average distance of the Sun and the Moon to Earth is 108 times their respective diameters.&nbsp;</p><p>In last week's class, we used the hand, instead of mala beads, to count to 108. The fingers have 12 joints, and you can count them in a spiral inwards by moving the thumb. If you do this 9 times, you reach 108. &nbsp;Regardless of spiritual significance, it's a good way of keeping the joints of the hand supple and arthritis at bay!</p></div>

As motivation, first about the benefits of your yoga! &nbsp;

* You gain flexibility and mobility throughout the entire body.
* Plus strength and tone in your muscles.
* Learn to breathe deeply (we rarely practise this day-to-day).
* Help manage your stress levels.
* Release tension â€“ physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual.
* Let go of the old and welcome in the new for 2018.

Key tips:

Try to aim for short regular sessions on as many days as you can (15-20 mins say)

Pick a time (before breakfast, or as soon as you come in after work) and keep to it

Leave your mat in a quiet place where you can practise undisturbed

Use music if you like, or light a candle.

What to do:

I suggest starting with the standing warm ups in this colder weather we've been doing in class in recent weeks.

* The four part activation: twists/forward and backward steps with arm raises/squats/ side to side warrior 1
* The four part leg raises: inhale knee and arms up/exhale knee out arms down/raise arms up/ &nbsp;exhale both down
* Child/cat/dog moves on your mat
* Some work for the core/abdominals (eg leg raises)
* Backbends on your tummy
* Rest in child -&nbsp; then a few minutes to relax, or add in some seated stretches, twists and bridge

The wall can be used too, see the sketches below to remind you of this week's class.

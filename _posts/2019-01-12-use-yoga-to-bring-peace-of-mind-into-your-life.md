I can't be the only one switching off from the news these days. I think it's also a time of year when we also tend to look inward and worry more, despite all the bright urgency of those new year resolutions.

It takes consistent effort to keep worry at bay, and I find yoga helps with this the most. So rather than practicing yoga for some specific physical benefit, I find myself drifting more and more toward doing it for the mental benefit—to feel more centered in the body, present in the moment, and aware of the simple joys in life.

Even if its just a few minutes of legs up the wall, and child and downward dog stretches.

A wall can give us support both physically and emotionally: it helps take the weight off your shoulders and encourages you to just let go.

Here are a few of the things we did in our first class of the year – you'll probably find other yoga postures or stretches you can do using the wall for yourself.

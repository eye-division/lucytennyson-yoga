Doing yoga at home in between classes will help you keep mobile for the rest of your life - but it's often hard to know what to do, or get started. You have to first, establish a routine, by deciding what time of day, and how long.&nbsp; Say 10 minutes every morning, for example, or 20 minutes three times a week.

The clockface chart below is my attempt to help you get started and into a routine. The idea is to go round the clock from 1 pm. You can chose just to go as far as 2 pm (two warm up sequences) and then jump to 12 pm (a short relaxation). That'll give you a 10 minute sequence. If you add say 3, 5 and 7 pm, then you build up to 20 minutes.

You can vary the numbers, but always add the first two and the last, and go in the order of the clock. The whole 12 will take about an hour. Once you get used to this sequence, you can vary the postures within each number, (for example, trying&nbsp; different backbends, standing postures or warm up sequences).

We'll be using this clockface this term to help get you started.

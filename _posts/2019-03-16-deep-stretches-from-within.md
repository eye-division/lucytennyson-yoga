The psoas muscle is one of the largest and most important skeletal muscles in the human body. Running on the left and right sides, and stretching from the lower spinal column down to the femur in the leg, it is the only muscle that connects the upper to the lower body.

The psoas helps us stand upright and walk, and plays a vital role in postural alignment, movement and overall well-being. Its function also extends beyond the mechanical to involve the nerve complex. It tends to tighten during moments of stress, as well as when the knee is bent in towards the body (for example when we sit). It can be beneficial to try to open up in the front of the body to allow the psoas to release.

Many yoga postures involve this deep seated muscle, especially anything involving a back bend such as Warrior 1, bridge and lunges.&nbsp; Our yoga sequence this week offered a variety of poses, aimed at first warming up the whole body (using variations of vajrasana or kneeling posture).

We began by sitting over blocks with the aim of lifting up through the spine to encourage the chest to move more freely in a sequence of breathing exercises. We followed with some warms ups (such as cat and downward dog, and child), and then from kneeling, worked on variations of vajrasana.

This was followed by supine leg raises to engage and tone up the core, and then some stretches to open up the front of the body and the psoas.

The diagram shows the psoas muscle. Below is a reminder of some of what we practised in class this week.

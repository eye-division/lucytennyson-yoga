Now we have passed through the autumn equinox nights are starting to draw in. It's a time of change, as we move from the summer into autumn and we start to look ahead towards winter. We might start making plans for the year to come.

It can be an unsettling time, and this is reflected in the weather. This week's practice focussed on balance. Not just in standing balances such as eagle and tree, but sitting and and doing alternate nostril breath, or using muscular effort in boat.&nbsp;

Our equinox practice was based around the clock face sequence I used last week.

        <h2>What is a class like?</h2>
        <p>I am a hatha yoga teacher, and I enjoy working with beginners and older students. My classes are small and friendly, and I like to take a relatively gentle approach and moving at the pace of the class, offering students the opportunity to deepen their practice with some stronger poses when they are ready. Don't worry if you think you won't be fit or bendy enough. There's no such thing as 'being no good at yoga' .. or thinking .. 'I'm too stiff/old/inflexible/overweight': Everyone - older students, those carrying a few extra pounds, sports people needing a good stretch, and men - yoga is for you!</p>
        <p><em>I like to pay close attention to alignment and posture in order to encourage everyone to practise safely and within their own limits.</em></p>
        <p>My classes begin with a slow warm up, paying attention to breathing and posture, before moving more deeply into the yoga poses (asanas) themselves, and ending with a short relaxation. My aim is to encourage students to work safely, focussing on improving strength and flexibility, whilst helping to let go of tension. Above all, my yoga classes are friendly and enjoyable, and a great way of coming together with other people to develop the good both in our bodies and ourselves.</p>

        <h2>What is yoga?</h2>
        <p>Yoga is a physical, mental and spiritual practice, with a long and varied history in India dating back over a thousand years.</p>
        <p>Hatha (or active) yoga is taught in gyms and halls up and down the country today, having blossomed into a myriad of different styles such as Iyengar, Ashtanga, Vinyasa Flow and Hot yoga.</p>
        <p>There are many definitions. I like to think of yoga as making the most of our potential: physically, mentally and spiritually.&nbsp; The The original Sanskrit word can mean 'yoke' , while the term <em>hatha</em> can be translated as strong or forceful. ( Alternatively it can be looked at as <i>ha</i> meaning "sun" and <i>tha</i> meaning "moon"). It refers to a set of physical exercises known as asanas, or postures, which can be put into sequences of asanas, designed to align limbs, muscles, and bones. At a deeper level these postures can open the many channels of the body&mdash;especially the main channel, the spine&mdash; which enables energy to flow more freely.</p>
        <p>Yoga also embraces working with the breath (pranayama) and meditation. As well as stretching and toning our bodies, a class can also help us emotionally, lifting our spirits and restoring energy levels.</p>
        <p>All forms of yoga (and there are many, as it is an evolving tradition) share a common source. The word yoga comes from the Sanskrit yuj, which means &lsquo;yoke&rsquo; or &lsquo;union&rsquo;. Practising the postures and breathing with awareness develops harmony, unifying the mind, body and spirit, and helping us to realise our nature.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Yoga philosophy</strong></p>
        <p>When asked to describe his teaching, one of the 20thcentury&rsquo;s leading figures in yoga B.K.S. Iyengar told &nbsp;the US magazine Yoga Journal:</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I just try to get the physical body in line with the mental body, the mental body in line with the intellectual body, and the intellectual body with the spiritual body so they are balanced. It&rsquo;s just pure traditional yoga, from our ancestors, from our gurus, from Patanjali.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>Patanjali lived in India around 2,200 years ago and wrote a classic text (the Yoga Sutras) covering the &lsquo;eight limbs&rsquo; (astanga) or stages of yoga. His eightfold path is still relevant today, and contains the famous phrase defining yoga as &ldquo;the stilling of the fluctuations of the mind&rdquo;. His text does not describe the physical yoga we practise today in the west, but acts as a guide to enlightenment via the eight limbs. These begin with ethical living, and include posture, breathing and meditation.</p>

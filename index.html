      <p>For information about <strong>yoga classes in Abingdon and on Zoom</strong>, read on ....<em></em></p>
      <p>I teach in a relatively gentle 'hatha' style to suit all ages and levels of fitness, and welcome beginners. I have been teaching yoga in Abingdon for 12 years, and more recently online using Zoom.&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>Yoga workshop Monday August 29 2 - 4. 30 pm: Get Ready for Autumn</h3>
      <p>Set yourself up for the autumn term of yoga with this special workshop. We'll do two yoga sessions, one energising, and one cooling and relaxing. All levels welcome, and handouts provided. I'll provide refreshments in between sessions in the dining room at St Ethelwolds. Cost &pound;20, contact me to reserve your place (pay on the day).&nbsp; We'll practise in the garden if fine.</p>

  <p><strong>ABINGDON YOGA&nbsp; AND ONLINE ZOOM&nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Gentle and accessible yoga for all levels, all ages!&nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>I teach in a softer 'hatha' style to suit all ages and levels of fitness, and welcome beginners. I have been teaching yoga in Abingdon for 15 years, and more recently online using Zoom.&nbsp; My studio based classes are often full, as limited to eight spaces, so do get in touch to book your place.</p>

"*The more often we practise bringing our attention back to the present moment through yoga, the more skilled we will become at fully experiencing life as we are living it, and the happier we will be.‚Äù*

I have been teaching yoga in the Oxford area since 2011. As well as yoga, I have enjoyed a range of sport all my life, and find the two very complementary. Yoga I believe is enabling me to continue to lead an active life well into my 'retirement' years.

**Training**

My genes did not give me a flexible body, and I had a tendency towards tight muscles and lower back pain in my twenties. By practising yoga, I remember becoming able to reach my toes for the first time! And gradually, with patience, I have been able to 'let go'. I think my own experiences enable me to understand what it is like to feel stiff, creaky or have some kind of injury that prevents a full range of movement.

However, &nbsp;it was an interest in finding out more about the philosophical side of yoga that led me to take a Foundation course with [Michael Hutchinson](http://www.twobirdsyoga.com/), accredited by the British Wheel of Yoga, in 2008. A year later I embarked on teacher training with [Camyoga](http://www.camyoga.co.uk/), at Yoga Alliance 200 level. I continue to learn and develop through regularly attending British Wheel training days, and workshops with senior teachers such as Leslie Kaminoff, Peter Blackaby, Liz Lark and Donna Farhi. They all have very different approaches to yoga, some of which I try to reflect in my own teaching.

Before yoga, my main career was in journalism. I also ran the Artweeks festival in Oxfordshire for three years, and enjoy painting and printmaking in my spare time. I work on a selective number of arts projects.

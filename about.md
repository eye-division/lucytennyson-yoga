I have been teaching yoga in the Oxford area since 2011. As well as yoga, I have practised sport all my life, and have found the two increasingly complementary over the years. I now no longer compete, but I believe yoga is enabling me to continue to lead an active life, and enjoy walking, cycling, kayaking and swimming.  

Unlike many yoga teachers, I have a naturally rather inflexible body and tight muscles. By practising yoga, I remember becoming able to reach my toes for the first time! I think my own experiences enable me to understand what it is like to feel stiff, creaky or have some kind of injury that prevents a full range of movement.  

I came late in life into teaching, and it was an interest in finding out more about the philisophical side of yoga that led me to take a Foundation course with (Michael Hutchinson)[http://www.twobirdsyoga.com/], accredited by the British Wheel of Yoga, in 2008. A year later I embarked on teacher training with (Camyoga)[http://www.camyoga.co.uk/], at Yoga Alliance 200 level. I continue to learn and develop through regularly attending British Wheel training days, and workshops with senior teachers such as Leslie Kaminoff, Peter Blackaby, Liz Lark and Donna Farhi. They all have very different approaches to yoga, some of which I try to reflect in my own teaching.  

My main career has been in journalism. I also ran the Artweeks festival in Oxfordshire for three years, and enjoy painting and printmaking in my spare time. I work on a selective number of arts projects.

"*The more often we practise bringing our attention back to the present moment through yoga, the more skilled we will become at fully experiencing life as we are living it, and the happier we will be.‚Äù*

I have been teaching yoga in the Oxford area since 2011. It's been a lifetime passion - I went to my first ever class in 1972 and have been hooked on yoga ever since!&nbsp; I've found it very complementary to sport, and is now enabling me to continue to remain active as I move into my 'retirement' years.

Unlike many other yoga teachers, I didn't begin with a flexible body, and had a tendency towards tight muscles and lower back pain in my twenties. By practising yoga, I remember reaching my toes for the first time! And gradually, with patience, I have been able to 'let go'. I think my own experiences enable me to understand what it is like to feel stiff, creaky or have some kind of injury that prevents a full range of movement.

**Training**

It wasn't teaching, but an interest in finding out more about the philosophical side of yoga that led me to take a Foundation course with [Michael Hutchinson](http://www.twobirdsyoga.com/), accredited by the British Wheel of Yoga, in 2008. A year later I embarked on teacher training with [Camyoga](http://www.camyoga.co.uk/), at Yoga Alliance 200 level. I continue to learn and develop through regularly attending British Wheel training days, and workshops with senior teachers such as Leslie Kaminoff, Peter Blackaby, Liz Lark and Donna Farhi. They all have very different approaches to yoga, some of which I try to reflect in my own teaching.

Before yoga, my main career was in journalism. I also ran the Artweeks festival in Oxfordshire for three years, and enjoy painting and printmaking in my spare time.

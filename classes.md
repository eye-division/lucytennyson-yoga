As the classes are small, up to eight, most fill up quickly at the beginning of each term. Students are asked if possible to book for the whole term of between 10 and 12 weeks.

Cost:&nbsp; A termly pass works out at £9 a class. If there is a space available drop in is £12.&nbsp; Five online Zoom classes £30, or drop in £8. Contact me for online payment details, or to arrange payment by cheque/cash.&nbsp;

**Afternoon workshop: Monday 29 th August&nbsp; 2 pm - 4.30 pm**

The theme is Preparing for Autumn: Strength to meet the challenges to come

Schedule:

* 2-3 pm Energising yoga warm up
* 3-3.45 pm Chai and chat (or tea and cakes) in St Ethelwolds House
* 4-4.45 pm Yoga postures for calm and relaxation
* Feel free to stay on in the garden afterwards.

A lot of uncertainty faces us all this coming winter. We can’t predict what will happen, but we can turn to yoga to help build up strength and resilience to meet the challenges to come. What kind of yoga sequences form the backbone of a personal practice? &nbsp;What holds us back from getting the mat out at home? This workshop aims to encourage you to start building a regular home practice, and you’ll be given some handouts to use as a starting point.&nbsp;

We’ll enjoy a relaxed afternoon in the garden, with the option to go indoors if it rains.

Vinyasa in traditional yoga means a gradual progression or a step-by-step approach that systematically and appropriately takes a student from one point and safely lands them at the next point. It is sometimes described as the “breathing system,” or the union of breath and movement that make up the steps.

The word vinyasa has become well known in yoga studios up and down the country through the vinyasa flow classes which are largely based around the salute to the sun sequence. But it can mean any sequence of linked yoga postures that flow from one to the other.

We've done a few in class recently including these simple sequences below. You can check back through my blog and find other examples, including the moon salute, and the hands-free sequence of standing postures.

Mine are probably the gentlest classes around\! Although we do work hard in class too.

Even if some students in the class have been doing yoga for longer, it doesn't matter as there is no pressure to 'keep up' and I offer alternatives and use props such as blocks and cushions, to &nbsp;help people move more comfortably.

The emphasis is on finding ease in the body, and encouraging you to find ways of moving and getting the best out of yourself.

It's easy to hold a lot of tension in our shoulders without realising it. Quite often I find I have tightened up when driving, or writing emails on the computer.

The sequence below is my gentle warm up, which started with a relaxation aimed at releasing tension in the upper body. Alison followed up with a vinyasa flow sequence that included humble/devotional warrior, wide legs forward fold with hands clasped behind, eagle, and low cobra/sphinx.</p><p><img width="700" height="1007" alt="" src="http://www.lucytennyson.com/userfiles/yogablog27april.jpg" /></p></div>

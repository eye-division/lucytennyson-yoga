It's been a fabulous term of yoga with all of you, and I reluctantly bring my teaching to an end on Monday to go on holiday! I do hope you can come back in September, and we can continue to share our yoga together. I know it's not the same practising yoga at home - there's something about doing it in a group that brings an extra dimension. Plus we all find self discipline a challenge, yoga teachers included.

But, please find below several sequences (starting with a warm up and working up to a full sun salutation) taken from my classes which I hope will give you encouragement to get that mat out!

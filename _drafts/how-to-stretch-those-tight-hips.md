We all know we spend too much time sitting. It’s something I talk about in class often enough. A sedentary lifestyle can lead to obesity and poor general health – and that’s often why we come to a yoga class, to stretch out tight muscles.

But, if you have tight muscles from sitting (and I’m thinking in particular of the hip flexors), it can sometimes make things worse, if you do overdo poses such as triangle, warrior two and bridge. This is because we haven’t got enough flexibility before we go into the postures.

And it’s the back that can often suffer if we try too hard to force a stretch around the hips in these poses.

We explored this in class this week, first &nbsp;by noticing where we felt stiff and tight when sitting cross legged. Then we warmed up and followed this by working the muscles around the hips &nbsp;(‘picking apples’ stretches and the moving leg in cat).

Once these hip muscles were warm and toned, we went into some deeper stretching on the floor (lunges and a banana stretch). Then we were ready to &nbsp;end the session with some strong standing sequence – triangle, warrior 2, side angle and half moon – and coming down onto the floor for bridge.

We may all have dog days from time to time. But what about Moon Days?

Some dedicated yoga practitioners, in styles such as Ashtanga, have a day off on full and new moon days each month.&nbsp; They believe the moon has such a strong effect on our energies, it is best to rest.

They even link it to the breath cycle. Full moon energy they say corresponds to the end of inhalation when the force of prana (or energy flow) is greatest. This is an expansive, upward moving force that makes us feel energetic and emotional, but not well grounded.

The new moon energy corresponds to the end of exhalation when the opposite force of apana is greatest, with energy draining out on the out breath. Apana is a contracting, downward moving force that makes us feel calm and grounded.

Certainly the breath underpins our health and well being, and I reflect this in my teaching. But very yoga practitioner is different, and personally I prefer to think of things in a symbolic way. An example we used in class this week is Tadasana, or Mountain Pose.

The sketch below aim to act as a reminder of some of what we practised in class. Don't forget to do some gentle warm up sequences, before attempting the stronger stretches of the Moon Salutation. It is nice to finish off with some lying twists and relaxation, using the Mountain image as a visualisation.

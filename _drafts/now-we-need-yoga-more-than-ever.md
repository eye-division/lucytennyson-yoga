There’s never been a time like this. Yoga teachers everywhere are struggling to keep pace with ever changing safely requirements, and like everyone else face their own personal challenges. I missed my students who I didn’t see for six months. I missed the yoga classes I no longer was able to attend.

Back in March, I learnt about Zoom in a rapidly short space of time and started teaching online for the first time; and found a Zoom yoga class where the teacher watched us and made sure we were practising safely.

Now it’s time to return to studio based classes. I feel confident that my venues are following the latest guidelines, and that I am safe in the classes I go to at Nuffield Health in Oxford.

We need yoga to keep our bodies healthy and our immune systems strong to face whatever the winter will bring. We also need each other to, to keep ourselves strong and emotionally resilient through what for some has been a lonely time, and for others exceptionally stressful, due to work, family or money worries.

I look forward to sharing my practice with you, and will take a yoga as therapy approach, focussing on some of health issues that may have been neglected as a result of the pandemic: &nbsp;for example, osteoporosis, anxiety and stress, arthritis, back pain, balance, and insomnia.

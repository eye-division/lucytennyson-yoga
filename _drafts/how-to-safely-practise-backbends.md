Backbends are invigorating and strengthening. They stretch the front of the hips, and help open up the shoulders and chest, an area where lots of us hold tension. They build strength and power in the legs, arms and back muscles. By increasing mobility and awareness of the spine backbends improve posture and can help to alleviate some kinds of back and neck pain.

However, strong backbends don’t suit everyone, especially if you are new to yoga, or have a back issue. Be sure to first prepare&nbsp; by warming up the whole body with postures such as downward dog, cat and lunges, and gentle sun salutations such as we practised last week. &nbsp;

You need to think about why you are doing them, in particular opening up the front of the body, rather than pushing into an extreme posture. Most of us spend a lot of time rounding the shoulders over desks, driving or using gadgets: when we are doing a backbend, we are doing the reverse of this.

Try not to overuse the neck, or push too much into the lumbar area. Resist the temptation to throw the head back; instead try drawing the chin in toward you, widening the collarbones and lifting the sternum up. This will help you to focus the backbend more in the upper back, broadening the chest and releasing some of the tightness of rounded shoulders.

After warming up, start with a lying sequence: sphinx, low cobra, locust, full cobra. From kneeling, take the arms back in camel posture.&nbsp; Standing up, try warrior 1 and dancer (which we’ll move onto in class this coming week). Remember, take good rests when you feel like it, or afterwards in a neutral spine position such as seated staff pose (sitting upright with legs out) and downward dog.

I’ve had a look around the internet to see if I can find any online sequences to recommend. Most of them are very extreme and best avoided. Inevitably, the teachers are young, super fit,&nbsp; slim and flexible.

This is the only one I found with a more normal looking teacher\!

While Yoga Journal recommends this core sequence to help you tone up and prepare for backbends.

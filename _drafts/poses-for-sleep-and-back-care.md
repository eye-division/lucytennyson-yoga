This week, we enjoyed a calming session of deep stretches designed to help us relax and prepare for a good night's sleep.

I don't think you need to do these just before bed, any time in the evening to suit you, and before an evening meal if you tend to eat later. Afterwards, I would try and have a quiet evening, cutting out the use of electronic devices with blue light that is said to upset our sleep patterns. And of course no caffeine after 2pm!

The first part of our sequence is also a good routine for back care, starting off with plenty of warm up stretches on the floor.

Inbetween, you can add in some more active postures if you wish, standing and sitting cross legged. And ending with a relaxation.

Here is a reminder of some of our sequences

Many flow sequences such as salute to the sun can put a lot of strain on the wrists and arms. The standing flow sequence I taught recently can be&nbsp; taken very slowly and gently, and requires no downward dog movements.

It was put together by a well regarded yoga teacher and author Leslie Kaminoff and you can watch in online on the Yoga Journal website, click here to see it.

I hope my notes below act as a reminder - just try it and remember to use the breath to guide you in and out of the moments. Start on one side, and repeat each move three times, or hold for three breaths, then switch to the other leg.

This week sees the transition from longer days to longer nights around the autumn equinox. Our attention starts to shift towards the coming winter as the nights start to feel appreciably colder and the evenings grow darker. It's a time when we can feel unsettled, perhaps, by the changes going on, and thinking about how we might plan ahead. Whatever is going on in your life, you can use your practice to find stability and consolidate your energies.

The practice below repeats the clockface sequence we used last week. There are 12 suggested yoga steps, starting with warm ups and moving through spinal mobility, backbends, strength, balances and stretching for flexibility.

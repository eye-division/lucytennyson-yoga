## A simple home practice

If you can get into a routine of practising at home a couple of days a week you&#39;ll really notice an improvement in your yoga. You might even start to miss it if you stop! This sequence breaks down into a standing warm up, followed by sun salutations - as slow as you like, and as many times as you like (even just twice). You can miss these out as well, especially in the evenings. Then come down to child and carry on from there.

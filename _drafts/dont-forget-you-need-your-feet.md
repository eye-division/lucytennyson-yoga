Proper alignment of the feet in all yoga poses is key to a good yoga practice. Try and spend some time grounding though the four corners of the feet (the big toe mound, the baby toe mound, the inner heel and the outer heel), lifting the arches, and equally distributing weight between each foot.

Notice if you have any habits such as shifting the weight to the inner or outer edges. Think about the toes - try lifting them up towards the sky while standing. Then spread them wider apart. Move the big toe, then the little one, and then the three in between.

Spend some time in kneeling postures, either resting on the heels, or with the toes tucked under. Use blankets and cushions to help soften any areas that are tight and uncomfortable.

Here's a reminder of some of this week's practice, which included a workout for the feet, ankles and toes.

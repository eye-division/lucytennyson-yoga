Asteya (non stealing) is the third Yama of Patanjali’s 5 Yamas of the Yoga Sutras. Just like the other Yamas & Niyamas though, ‘non-stealing’ can mean more than not physically taking something from someone else.

Asteya is mentioned and debated throughout many Indian texts, including the Yoga Sutras, the religious text the Mahabarata (of which the Bhagavad Gita is part), and the long philosophical writings collectively known as the Upanishads and the Vedas. Gandhi also saw how important the practice of ‘non-stealing’ was and considered it one of his ’11 Vows’, in which he expanded beyond the physical act of stealing – importantly – that humankind’s greed and craving for more things including wealth is also a form of stealing.

This concept of Asteya has particular resonance for us today, with current concerns about the ecology of our planet, and whether we are living sustainable lifestyles. Are we ‘stealing’ from future generations to come?

How might we apply the idea of ‘non-stealing’ to our yoga practice? I’m sure you haven’t even dreamt of stealing someone’s blocks or mat\! Your suggestions welcome.

In our yoga sequence this week, we worked on the legs. &nbsp;After a standing warm up, we did chair, and the head to knee forward bend, or pyramid pose (using blocks if your hands don’t reach the floor). &nbsp;Lying down, we did some pelvic rocks, first actively zipping up with the core muscles, and then passively using the leg muscles only. We finished off with some seated stretches, cross legged and then with the legs straight out in front.

Take enough yoga classes and you'll eventually hear one of your teachers quote from Patanjali’s Yoga Sutras, an ancient guide to classical, or raja (royal), yoga. Written approximately two millennia ago, the text isn’t long – it is made up of 195 short one line aphorisms (called sutras). But it is very dense, and open to different interpretations, which means it continues to be studied and discussed by yoga practitioners and scholars today.

The Sutras are attributed to Patanjali, although no conclusive evidence exists as to who he was. One of the few statues in existence shows a man sitting on a coiled up snake. Nobody knows either quite when they date from, as they would have first been passed down orally. They were short and just contained the essence of yoga philosophy, and were passed on from teacher to student by chanting.

The Sutras act as a guide to the practice of meditation, and make little reference to the active postures we do in class today. Amongst many other things, they outline theeight-fold path leading to liberation, known as the&nbsp;*‘Ashtanga Yoga System’*&nbsp;or ‘8 Limbs of Yoga’.&nbsp;They are written down in Sanskrit, the holy language of India, which is probably the oldest spoken language in the world still in use today.

The myths

One myth relating to Patanjali says that in order to teach yoga on earth, he fell from heaven in the form of a little snake, into the upturned plans (a gesture known as anjali) of his virgin mother, a powerful yogini. The myths draw on the rich pantheon of Hindu gods – for instance, he's regarded as an incarnation of the thousand-headed serpent-king named Remainder (Shesha) or Endless (Ananta), whose coils are said to support the god Vishnu.

This week’s class

We began this week with a short sequence to warm up all the joints in the body, from top to toes, which I learnt on my recent visit to India. All the teaching I encountered on my study tour focussed on the breath, with all the movement in and out of the postures following the inhale and the exhale. We ended with the OM Shanti Shanti Shanti chant.

Try to begin and end any practice you do at home with a focus on your breathing – remember the yogic breath: three part inhale first into the lower, then the mid and upper chest, and a similar pattern on the exhale.

Here is a reminder of the kneeling salute to the sun sequence.
